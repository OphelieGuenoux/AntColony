Part of the projet I made for Adludio. 
It's based on the TSP problem, but the "town" are bitcode. 
As an example "10001" could be a town. 

First the ants goes randomly through the graph and initialize the distance between every two towns. 
Then, a new generation of ants goes through the graph and create "Genoma" based on the list of towns they followed, regarding the distances and the number of pheromones. 

It's all node.js (javascript)
